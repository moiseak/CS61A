<p>In this project, you will create a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> game called Ants Vs.
SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you
can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade
your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they
will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your
queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games'
<a href="https://www.ea.com/studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies">Plants Vs. Zombies</a>.</p>

<p>This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm,
focusing on material from <a href="https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/25-object-oriented-programming.html">Chapter 2.5</a> of Composing Programs. The
project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.</p>

<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 24 points.
23 points are for correctness,
1 point is for submitting Phase 1 and Phase 2 by the first checkpoint date.</p>

<p>You can get 1 EC point for submitting the entire project by
<strong>Wednesday, July 24</strong>. You can get up to 4 additional EC points by completing the optional EC questions.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ants.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, <b> submit the required files to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.</b></p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above</b>. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: Ants Vs. SomeBees
Ok, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<!-- <p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. <b>If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission. </b></p>
-->

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

-->


<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="ants.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<!---
<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

-->

<p>If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>


<p>A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new
bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony.
Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try
to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a
different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food or
throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of
the tunnel (ants lose), the bees destroy a <code>QueenAnt</code> if it exists (ants lose),
or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (ants win).</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="static/assets/screenshot.gif" />


<h3 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h3>


<p><strong>The Colony</strong>. This is where the game takes place. The colony consists of
several <code>Place</code>s that are chained together to form tunnels through which the
bees travel. The colony also has some quantity of food which can be expended in
order to place an ant in a tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Places</strong>. A place links to another place to form a tunnel. The player can
put a single ant into each place. However, there can be many bees in a single
place.</p>

<p><strong>The Hive</strong>. This is the place where bees originate. Bees exit the beehive to
enter the ant colony.</p>

<p><strong>Ants</strong>. The player places an ant into the colony by selecting from the
available ant types at the top of the screen.
Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different
amount of colony food to place. The two most basic ant types are the <code>HarvesterAnt</code>,
which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>, which
throws a leaf at a bee each turn. You will be implementing many more!</p>

<p><strong>Bees</strong>. Each turn, a bee either advances to the next place in the tunnel if no
ant is in its way, or it stings the ant in its way. Bees win when at least one
bee reaches the end of a tunnel. In addition to the orange bees, there are
yellow wasps that do double damage and a green boss bee that is quite difficult
to vanquish.</p>


<h3 id="core-classes">Core classes</h3>


<p>The concepts described above each have a corresponding class that encapsulates
the logic for that concept. Here is a summary of the main classes involved in
this game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>GameState</code></strong>: Represents the colony and some state information about the game,
  including how much food is available, how much time has elapsed, where the
  <code>AntHomeBase</code> is, and all the <code>Place</code>s in the game.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Place</code></strong>: Represents a single place that holds insects. At most one <code>Ant</code> can
  be in a single place, but there can be many <code>Bee</code>s in a single place. <code>Place</code> objects have an
  <code>exit</code> to the left and an <code>entrance</code> to the right, which are also places.
  Bees travel through a tunnel by moving to a <code>Place</code>'s <code>exit</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Hive</code></strong>: Represents the place where <code>Bee</code>s start out (on the right of the tunnel).</li>
  <li><strong><code>AntHomeBase</code></strong>: Represents the place <code>Ant</code>s are defending (on the left of the tunnel). If <code>Bee</code>s get here, they win :(</li>
  <li><strong><code>Insect</code></strong>: A base class for <code>Ant</code> and <code>Bee</code>. Each insect has a <code>health</code>
  attribute representing its remaining health and a <code>place</code> attribute representing the <code>Place</code> where
  it is currently located. Each turn, every active <code>Insect</code> in the game
  performs its <code>action</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Ant</code></strong>: Represents ants. Each <code>Ant</code> subclass has special attributes or a
  special <code>action</code> that distinguish it from other <code>Ant</code> types. For example, a
  <code>HarvesterAnt</code> gets food for the colony and a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> attacks <code>Bee</code>s.
  Each ant type also has a <code>food_cost</code> attribute that indicates how much it
  costs to deploy one unit of that type of ant.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Bee</code></strong>: Represents bees. Each turn, a bee either moves to the <code>exit</code> of
  its current <code>Place</code> if the <code>Place</code> is not <code>blocked</code> by an ant, or stings the
  ant occupying its same <code>Place</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>For full credit:</strong>
submit with Phase 1 and Phase 2 complete by <strong>Monday, July 22</strong> (worth
1 pt).</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first phase you will complete the implementation that will allow for
basic gameplay with the two basic <code>Ant</code>s: the <code>HarvesterAnt</code> and the
<code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>Answer a set of conceptual questions after you have read the
<em>entire</em> <code>ants.py</code> file by running this <code>ok</code> command:</p>

<pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 00 -u<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q00-u" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>
        <script>
        document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-q00-u").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q 00 -u', "copy-code-python3ok-q00-u");
        </script>
        <br/>

<p>If you get stuck while answering these questions, you can try reading through
<code>ants.py</code> again or asking questions on Ed.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>A note on unlocking tests</strong>:
If you'd like to review the unlocking questions
after you have completed the unlocking test,
you can navigate to (within the <code>ants</code> folder),
the <code>tests</code> folder.
For example, after unlocking Problem 0,
you can review the unlocking test at <code>tests/00.py</code>.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="problem-1-1-pt">Problem 1 (1 pt)</h3>


<p><strong>Part A</strong>: Currently, there is no cost
for placing any type of <code>Ant</code>, and so there is no challenge to the
game. The base class <code>Ant</code> has a <code>food_cost</code> of
zero. Override this class attribute for <code>HarvesterAnt</code> and <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
according to the "Food Cost" column in the table below.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Initial Health</b></td>

<h3 id="problem-2-1-pt">Problem 2 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>In this problem, you'll complete <code>Place.__init__</code> by adding code that tracks entrances. Right
now, a <code>Place</code> keeps track only of its <code>exit</code>. We would like a <code>Place</code> to keep
track of its entrance as well. A <code>Place</code> needs to track only one <code>entrance</code>.
Tracking entrances will be useful when an <code>Ant</code> needs to see what <code>Bee</code>s are in
front of it in the tunnel.</p>

<p>However, simply passing an entrance to a <code>Place</code> constructor will be
problematic; we would need to have both the exit and the entrance before
creating a <code>Place</code>! (It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg">chicken or the
egg</a>
problem.) To get around this problem, we will keep track of entrances in the
following way instead. <code>Place.__init__</code> should use this logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A newly created <code>Place</code> always starts with its <code>entrance</code> as <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>If the <code>Place</code> has an <code>exit</code>, then the <code>exit</code>'s <code>entrance</code> is set to
  that <code>Place</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> Remember that when the <code>__init__</code> method is called, the first parameter,
<code>self</code>, is bound to the newly created object</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> Try drawing out two <code>Place</code>s next to each other if things get confusing.
In the GUI, a place's <code>entrance</code> is to its right while the <code>exit</code> is to its left.</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> Remember that <code>Place</code>s are not stored in a list, so you can't index into anything to access them. This means that you <strong>can't</strong> do something like <code>colony[index + 1]</code> to access an adjacent <code>Place</code>. How <em>can</em> you move from one place to another?</p></blockquote>

<p>In order for a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> to throw a leaf, it must know which bee to hit.
The provided implementation of the <code>nearest_bee</code> method in the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
class only allows them to hit bees in the same <code>Place</code>. Your job is to fix it
so that a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> will <code>throw_at</code> the nearest bee in front of it <strong>that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.</strong>
This includes bees that are in the same <code>Place</code> as a <code>ThrowerAnt</code></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> All <code>Place</code>s have an <code>is_hive</code> attribute which is <code>True</code> when that
place is the <code>Hive</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Change <code>nearest_bee</code> so that it returns a random <code>Bee</code> from the nearest place that
contains bees. Your implementation should follow this logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start from the current <code>Place</code> of the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</li>
  <li>For each place, return a random bee if there is any, and if not,
  inspect the place in front of it (stored as the current place's <code>entrance</code>).</li>
  <li>If there is no bee to attack, return <code>None</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint</em>: The <code>random_bee</code> function provided in <code>ants.py</code> returns a random
bee from a list of bees or <code>None</code> if the list is empty.</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><em>Hint</em>: As a reminder, if there are no bees present at a <code>Place</code>,
then the <code>bees</code> attribute of that <code>Place</code> instance will be an empty list.</p></blockquote>

<p>After implementing <code>nearest_bee</code>, a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> should be able to <code>throw_at</code> a
<code>Bee</code> in front of it that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.</p>

<p>Now you're ready to try what you've built. To start a graphical game, run:</p>

<pre><code>python3 gui.py</code></pre>

<p>After you start the graphical version, the game is (usually) available at
http://127.0.0.1:31415/.</p>

<p>The game has several options that you will use throughout the project,
which you can view with <code>python3 gui.py &#x2d;&#x2d;help</code>.</p>

<pre><code>usage: gui.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]

optional arguments:
  &#x2d;h, &#x2d;&#x2d;help     show this help message and exit
  &#x2d;d DIFFICULTY  sets difficulty of game (test/easy/normal/hard/extra&#x2d;hard)
  &#x2d;w, &#x2d;&#x2d;water    loads a full layout with water
  &#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD    number of food to start with when testing</code></pre>

<p>You can refresh the webpage to restart the game, but if you changed your code,
you need to terminate <code>gui.py</code> and run it again. To terminate <code>gui.py</code>, you can
hit <code>Ctrl + C</code> on the terminal.</p>

<p>You cannot have multiple tabs of this same Ants GUI open simultaneously or they
will all error.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>For full credit:</strong>

<p>Now that you've implemented basic gameplay with two types of <code>Ant</code>s, let's
add some flavor to the ways ants can attack bees. In this problem and on, you'll be
implementing several different <code>Ant</code>s with different attack strategies.</p>

<p><strong>After you implement each <code>Ant</code> subclass in these sections, you'll need to set its
<code>implemented</code> class attribute to <code>True</code></strong> so that that type of ant will show up in the
GUI. Feel free to try out the game with each new ant to test the functionality!</p>

<p>With all following ants from now on, try <code>python3 gui.py</code> to play against a
full swarm of bees in a multi-tunnel layout and try <code>&#x2d;d hard</code> or
<code>&#x2d;d extra&#x2d;hard</code> if you want a real challenge! If the bees are too numerous to
vanquish, you might need to create some new ants.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-2-pt">Problem 4 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A <code>ThrowerAnt</code> is a powerful threat to the bees, but it has a high food cost.
In this problem, you'll implement two subclasses of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that are less
costly but have constraints on the distance they can throw:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>LongThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after following
  at least 5 <code>entrance</code> transitions. It cannot hit <code>Bee</code>s that are in the same
  <code>Place</code> as it or the first 4 <code>Place</code>s in front of it. If there are two
  <code>Bee</code>s, one too close to the <code>LongThrower</code> and the other within its range,
  the <code>LongThrower</code> should only throw at the farther <code>Bee</code>, which is within its range, instead of trying to hit the closer <code>Bee</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>ShortThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after following
  at most 3 <code>entrance</code> transitions. It cannot throw at any bees further than 3
  <code>Place</code>s in front of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these specialized throwers can <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is exactly 4
<code>Place</code>s away.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Initial Health</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="static/assets/ants/Short.gif" /> <br>

    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To implement these new throwing ants, your <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code> classes
should inherit the <code>nearest_bee</code> method from the base <code>ThrowerAnt</code> class.
The logic of choosing which bee a thrower ant will attack is
the same, except the <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code> ants where their range is
limited by a lower and upper bound, respectively.</p>

<p>To do this, modify the <code>nearest_bee</code> method to reference <code>lower_bound</code> and <code>upper_bound</code> attributes,
and only return a bee if it is within range.</p>

<p>Make sure to give these <code>lower_bound</code> and <code>upper_bound</code> attributes appropriate
values in the <code>ThrowerAnt</code> class so that the behavior of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> is
unchanged. Then, implement the subclasses <code>LongThrower</code> and <code>ShortThrower</code>
with appropriately constrained ranges.</p>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> need to repeat any code between <code>ThrowerAnt</code>,
<code>ShortThrower</code>, and <code>LongThrower</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> <code>float(&#x27;inf&#x27;)</code> returns an infinite positive value represented as a
float that can be compared with other numbers.</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> <code>lower_bound</code> and <code>upper_bound</code> should mark an inclusive range.</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
Make sure your class attributes are called <code>upper_bound</code> and <code>lower_bound</code>
The tests directly reference these attribute names, and will error
if you use another name for these attributes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Don't forget to set the <code>implemented</code> class attribute of <code>LongThrower</code> and
<code>ShortThrower</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-3-pt">Problem 5 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>FireAnt</code>, which does damage when it receives damage. Specifically,
if it is damaged by <code>amount</code> health units, it does a damage of
<code>amount</code> to all bees in its place (this is called <em>reflected damage</em>).
If it dies, it does an additional amount of damage, as specified by its <code>damage</code> attribute,
which has a default value of <code>3</code> as defined in the <code>FireAnt</code> class.</p>

<p>To implement this, override <code>Insect</code>'s <code>reduce_health</code> method.
Your overriden method should call the <code>reduce_health</code> method inherited from
the superclass (<code>Ant</code>) <em>which inherits from it's superclass Insect</em> to reduce the current <code>FireAnt</code> instance's health.
Calling the <em>inherited</em> <code>reduce_health</code> method on a <code>FireAnt</code> instance reduces
the insect's <code>health</code> by the given <code>amount</code> and removes the insect from its
place if its <code>health</code> reaches zero or lower.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em>
Do <em>not</em> call <code>self.reduce_health</code>,
or you'll end up stuck in a recursive loop. (Can you see why?)</p></blockquote>

<p>However, your method needs to also include the reflective damage logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine the reflective damage amount:
  start with the <code>amount</code> inflicted on the ant,
  and then add <code>damage</code> if the ant's health has dropped to or below 0.</li>
  <li>For each bee in the place, damage them with the total amount by
  calling the appropriate <code>reduce_health</code> method for each bee.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
Remember that when any <code>Ant</code> loses all its health, it is removed from its <code>place</code>,
so pay careful attention to the order of your logic in <code>reduce_health</code>.</p></blockquote>

you <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements">may not visit all the elements</a>.
This can be prevented by making a copy of the list.
You can either use a list slice, or use the built-in <code>list</code> function to make sure
we do not affect the original list.</p></blockquote>

<p>Implement the <code>HungryAnt</code>, which will select a random <code>Bee</code> from its <code>place</code> and
deal damage to the <code>Bee</code> equal to the <code>Bee</code>'s health, eating it whole. After
eating a <code>Bee</code>, a <code>HungryAnt</code> must spend 3 turns chewing before being able to
eat again. While the <code>HungryAnt</code> is chewing, it is not able to eat (deal damage
to) any <code>Bee</code>s. If there is no bee in its place available to eat, the
<code>HungryAnt</code> will do nothing.</p>

<p>We have not provided you with a class header.
Implement the <code>HungryAnt</code> class from scratch. Give it a class attribute <code>name</code>
with the value <code>&#x27;Hungry&#x27;</code> (so that the graphics work) and a class attribute
<code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code> (so that you can use it in a game).</p>

<p>Give <code>HungryAnt</code> a <code>chewing_turns</code> <strong>class</strong> attribute that stores the number of

it has left to chew, initialized to 0, since it hasn't eaten anything at the
beginning. You can also think of <code>turns_to_chew</code> as the number of turns until a
<code>HungryAnt</code> can eat another <code>Bee</code>.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>action</code> method of the <code>HungryAnt</code>: First, check if it is chewing; if
so, decrement its <code>turns_to_chew</code>. Otherwise, eat a random <code>Bee</code> in its
<code>place</code> by reducing the <code>Bee</code>'s health to 0. Make sure to set the <code>turns_to_chew</code>
when a <code>Bee</code> is eaten!</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-3-pt">Problem 8 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Right now, our ants are quite frail. We'd like to provide a way to help them
last longer against the onslaught of the bees. Enter the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Initial Health</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="static/assets/ants/Bodyguard.gif" /> <br> <code>BodyguardAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To more easily implement the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>, we will break up this problem into 3 subparts.
In each part, we will making changes in either the <code>ContainerAnt</code> class, <code>Ant</code>
class, or <code>BodyguardAnt</code> class.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Note:</em>
We have separated out Question 8 into three different subparts. We recommend going through the unlocking test for each subpart before writing any code for it.
You will be tested through each subpart and each subpart is worth one point (for a total of three for the whole question).</p></blockquote>


<h4 id="problem-8a">Problem 8a</h4>

<p>First, we will define and work in a <code>ContainerAnt</code> parent class that we will later use for our <code>BodyguardAnt</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>BodyguardAnt</code> differs from a normal ant because it is a <code>ContainerAnt</code>; it can
contain another ant and protect it, all in one <code>Place</code>. When a <code>Bee</code> stings the
ant in a <code>Place</code> where one ant contains another, only the container is
damaged. The ant inside the container can still perform its original action.
If the container perishes, the contained ant still remains in the place (and
can then be damaged).</p>

<p>Each <code>ContainerAnt</code> has an instance attribute <code>ant_contained</code> that stores the ant it
contains. This ant, <code>ant_contained</code>, initially starts off as <code>None</code> to indicate that there is no ant being
stored yet. Implement the <code>store_ant</code> method so that it sets the <code>ContainerAnt</code>'s
<code>ant_contained</code> instance attribute to the <code>ant</code> argument passed in. Then implement the
<code>ContainerAnt</code>'s <code>action</code> method. This method will ensure that if our <code>ContainerAnt</code> currently contains an ant, <code>ant_contained</code>'s action is performed.</p>

<p>In addition, to ensure that a container and its contained ant can both occupy a place at
the same time (a maximum of two ants per place), but only if exactly one is a
container, we can create an <code>can_contain</code> method.</p>

<p>There is already an <code>Ant.can_contain</code> method, but it always returns <code>False</code>.
<strong>Override</strong> the method <code>can_contain</code> in <code>ContainerAnt</code> so that it takes an ant <code>other</code> as an
argument and returns <code>True</code> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This <code>ContainerAnt</code> does not already contain another ant.</li>
  <li>The other ant is not a container.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em>
You may find the <code>is_container</code> attribute that each <code>Ant</code> has useful for
checking if a specific <code>Ant</code> is a container.</p></blockquote>

        </script>
        <br/>


<h4 id="problem-8b">Problem 8b</h4>

<p>Next, we will be working in the <code>Ant</code> class.</p>

<p>Modify <code>Ant.add_to</code> to allow a container and its contained ant
to occupy the same place according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the ant originally occupying a place can contain the ant being added,
  then both ants occupy the place and original ant contains the ant being added.</li>
  <li>If the ant being added can contain the ant originally in the space, then both ants occupy the place and the
  (container) ant being added contains the original ant.</li>
  <li>If neither <code>Ant</code> can contain the other, raise the same
  <code>AssertionError</code> as before (the one already present in the starter
  code).</li>
  <li><strong>Important:</strong> If there are two ants in a specific <code>Place</code>,
  the <code>ant</code> attribute of the <code>Place</code> instance should <strong>refer to the container
  ant</strong>, and the container ant should contain the non-container ant.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint</em>:
You should also take advantage of the <code>can_contain</code> method you wrote
and avoid repeating code.</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you're getting an "unreachable code" warning for <code>Ant.add_to</code>
via the VSCode Pylance extension,
it's fine to ignore this specific warning,
as the code is actually run
(the warning <em>in this case</em> is inaccurate).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="problem-8c">Problem 8c</h4>

<p>Finally, we can work on implementing our <code>BodyguardAnt</code> class.</p>

<p>Add a <code>BodyguardAnt.__init__</code> that sets the initial amount of health for the Bodyguard ant.
We do not need to create an <code>action</code> method here since the <code>BodyguardAnt</code> class inherits it from the <code>ContainerAnt</code> class.
Also note that the <code>BodyguardAnt</code> does not do any damage.</p>

<p>The <code>BodyguardAnt</code> provides great defense, but they say the best defense is a
good offense. The <code>TankAnt</code> is a <code>ContainerAnt</code> that protects an ant in its place
and also deals 1 damage to all bees in its place each turn. Like any <code>ContainerAnt</code>, a <code>TankAnt</code> allows the ant
that it contains to perform its action each turn.</p>

<p>Let's add water to the colony! Currently there are only two types of places, the
<code>Hive</code> and a basic <code>Place</code>. To make things more interesting, we're going to
create a new type of <code>Place</code> called <code>Water</code>.</p>

<p>Only an insect that is waterproof can be placed in <code>Water</code>. In order
to determine whether an <code>Insect</code> is waterproof, add a new class attribute to the
<code>Insect</code> class named <code>is_waterproof</code> that is set to <code>False</code>. Since bees can fly,
their <code>is_waterproof</code> attribute is <code>True</code>, overriding the inherited value.</p>

<p>Now, implement the <code>add_insect</code> method for <code>Water</code>. First, add the insect to
the place regardless of whether it is waterproof. Then, if the insect is not
waterproof, reduce the insect's health to 0. <em>Do not repeat code from elsewhere
in the program.</em> Instead, use methods that have already been defined.</p>

<p>Finally, implement the <code>QueenAnt</code>. A queen is a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that inspires her
fellow ants through her bravery. In addition to the standard <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
action, a <code>QueenAnt</code> doubles the damage of all the ants behind her each time she
performs an action. However, once an ant's damage has been doubled, it <em>cannot</em> be
doubled again. Try to think of a way to keep track of whether an ant's damage has already been doubled (Hint: Use an instance attribute!)</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: The reflected damage of a <code>FireAnt</code> should not be doubled, only the
extra damage it deals when its health is reduced to 0.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility.  If a queen ever has its
health reduced to 0, the ants lose. You will need to override
<code>Insect.reduce_health</code> in <code>QueenAnt</code> and call <code>ants_lose()</code> in that case in
order to signal to the simulator that the game is over. (The ants also still
lose if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel.)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> For doubling the damage of all ants behind her, you may fill out the
<code>double</code> method defined in the <code>Ant</code> class, then call it from the <code>QueenAnt</code>
class.</p></blockquote>

without repeating code?</p></blockquote>

<!-- hack for separate blockquotes -->

<p>Implement two final thrower ants that do zero damage, but instead apply a temporary effect
on the <code>action</code> method of a <code>Bee</code> instance that they <code>throw_at</code>.
This "status" lasts for a certain number of turns, after which it ceases to take effect.</p>


<h3 id="problem-ec-1-1-pt">Problem EC 1 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>We will be implementing a new ant, <code>SlowThrower</code>, which inherits from <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>

<p><code>SlowThrower</code> throws sticky syrup at a bee, slowing it for 5 turns. When a bee is slowed, it does its regular Bee action when <code>gamestate.time</code> is even, and takes no action (does not move or sting) otherwise. If a bee is hit by syrup while it is already slowed, it is slowed for 5 turns starting from the <em>most recent</em> time it is hit by syrup. That is, if a bee is hit by syrup, takes 2 turns, and is hit by syrup again, it will now be slowed for 5 turns after the <em>second</em> time it is hit by syrup. So it will have been slowed for 7 turns total (not 10!).</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>In order to complete the implementations of this <code>SlowThrower</code>, you will
need to set its class attributes appropriately and implement the <code>throw_at</code> method in
<code>SlowThrower</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Important Restriction:</strong> You may <em>not</em> modify any code outside the <code>SlowThrower</code> class for this problem. That means you may <em>not</em> modify the <code>Bee.action</code> method directly. Our tests will check for this.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint</strong>: Take a look at <code>SlowThrower</code>'s parent class, <code>ThrowerAnt</code>. <code>ThrowerAnt</code>'s <code>action</code> method calls <code>throw_at</code>, which is what
you should be overriding in <code>SlowThrower</code>. What is passed into the <code>target</code> parameter in <code>SlowThrower</code>'s <code>throw_at</code> function and why?
What is <code>target.action</code> referring to?</p>

<p><strong>Implementation Hint</strong>: Assign <code>target.action</code> to a new function that conditionally calls <code>Bee.action</code>. You can create and use an
instance attribute to track how many more turns the bee will be slowed. Once the slowing effect is over, <code>Bee.action</code> should be called
<em>every</em> turn again.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You must implement Problem EC 1 (SlowThrower) correctly in order to pass the tests for this problem.
We will be implementing a new ant, <code>ScaryThrower</code>, which inherits from <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>ScaryThrower</code> intimidates a nearby bee, causing it to back away instead of advancing.
Here are some rules to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the bee is already right next to the Hive and cannot go back further, it should not move. To check if a bee is next to the Hive, you might find the <code>is_hive</code> instance attribute of <code>Place</code> useful.</li>
  <li>Bees remain scared until they have tried to back away <em>twice</em>. So, the back away effect lasts two turns.</li>
  <li>Bees cannot try to back away if they are <em>slowed</em> and <code>gamestate.time</code> is <em>odd</em>. This would be a turn they're frozen by SlowThrower!</li>
  <li>Once a bee has been scared once, it can't be scared ever again.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to complete the implementation of this <code>ScaryThrower</code>, you will

other methods of <code>Bee</code> such as action.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>NinjaAnt</code>, which damages all <code>Bee</code>s that pass by, but can never
be stung.</p>

    <td>5</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>A <code>NinjaAnt</code> does not block the path of a <code>Bee</code> that flies by. To implement
this behavior, first modify the <code>Ant</code> class to include a new class attribute
<code>blocks_path</code> that is set to <code>True</code>, then override the value of <code>blocks_path</code> to
<code>False</code> in the <code>NinjaAnt</code> class.</p>

<p>Second, modify the <code>Bee</code>'s method <code>blocked</code> to return <code>False</code> if either
there is no <code>Ant</code> in the <code>Bee</code>'s <code>place</code> or if there is an <code>Ant</code>, but
its <code>blocks_path</code> attribute is <code>False</code>. Now <code>Bee</code>s will just fly past
<code>NinjaAnt</code>s.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to make the <code>NinjaAnt</code> damage all <code>Bee</code>s that fly past.
Implement the <code>action</code> method in <code>NinjaAnt</code> to reduce the health of all <code>Bee</code>s
in the same <code>place</code> as the <code>NinjaAnt</code> by its <code>damage</code> attribute. Similar to
the <code>FireAnt</code>, you must iterate over a potentially changing list of bees.</p>

<h3 id="problem-ec-4-1-pt">Problem EC 4 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>We've been developing this ant for a long time in secret. It's so dangerous
that we had to lock it in the super hidden CS61A underground vault, but we
finally think it is ready to test out on the field. In this problem, you'll be
implementing the final ant -- <code>LaserAnt</code>, a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> with a twist.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Initial Health</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="static/assets/ants/Laser.gif" /> <br> <code>LaserAnt</code></td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>LaserAnt</code> shoots out a powerful laser, damaging all that dare
to stand in its path. Both <code>Bee</code>s and <code>Ant</code>s, of all types, are at
risk of being damaged by <code>LaserAnt</code>. When a <code>LaserAnt</code> takes its action,
it will damage all <code>Insect</code>s in its place (excluding itself, but including its
container if it has one) and the <code>Place</code>s in front of it, excluding the <code>Hive</code>.</p>

<p>If that were it, <code>LaserAnt</code> would be too powerful for us to contain.
The <code>LaserAnt</code> has a base damage of <code>2</code>. But, <code>LaserAnt</code>'s laser comes with
some quirks. The laser is weakened by <code>0.25</code> each place it travels away from
<code>LaserAnt</code>'s place. Additionally, <code>LaserAnt</code> has limited battery.
Each time <code>LaserAnt</code> actually damages an <code>Insect</code>, its
laser's total damage goes down by <code>0.0625</code> (1/16). This reduction is immediate so if there are
two <code>Bee</code>s in front of <code>LaserAnt</code> and on the same tile, it will do less damage to the second <code>Bee</code>.
If <code>LaserAnt</code>'s damage becomes negative due to these restrictions,
it simply does 0 damage instead.</p>

<blockquote><p>The exact order in which things are damaged within a turn does not matter.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to complete the implementation of this ultimate ant, read
through the <code>LaserAnt</code> class, set the class attributes appropriately,
and implement the following two functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>insects_in_front</code> is an instance method, called by the <code>action</code> method,
  that returns a dictionary where each key is an <code>Insect</code> and each
  corresponding value is the distance (in places) that that <code>Insect</code> is away
  from <code>LaserAnt</code>. The dictionary should include all <code>Insects</code> on the same
  place or in front of the <code>LaserAnt</code>, excluding <code>LaserAnt</code> itself.</li>
  <li><p><code>calculate_damage</code> is an instance method that takes in <code>distance</code>, the
  distance that an insect is away from the <code>LaserAnt</code> instance. It
  returns the damage that the <code>LaserAnt</code> instance should afflict based on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>distance</code> away from the <code>LaserAnt</code> instance that an <code>Insect</code> is.</li>
    <li>The number of <code>Insect</code>s that this <code>LaserAnt</code> has already damaged, stored in
    the <code>insects_shot</code> instance attribute.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to implementing the methods above, you may need to modify, add,
or use class or instance attributes in the <code>LaserAnt</code> class as needed.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong>: If an insect's health is unaffected, its health should <em>remain as a whole number (integer)</em>, as it was when the insect was initially created.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are no unlocking tests for this question.</p></blockquote>
